This repository includes 21 assignments on the topic of asynchronous programming.

Each task is described in comments to the class in which it should be implemented. All tasks are located in the [src/main/kotlin/impl](./src/main/kotlin/impl) directory.

You need to get all the tests from the [src/test/kotlin/impl](./src/test/kotlin/impl) directory to execute correctly. In total, there are 64 tests in the repository. Each test class corresponds to one task.

It is better to execute the tasks in the order in which they are numbered - this will allow you to move from the simplest tasks to more complex ones.
